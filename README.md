# Rolled Out Course Editor

This program will function only if you have the Rolled Out game installed.

For a personal data study, this is a special JSON file editor which allows users to manage the order of stages to be played in the Rolled Out game. A full directory scan of existing stages is invoked, and the information for all stages is stored into a cache JSON file for quick reference.
